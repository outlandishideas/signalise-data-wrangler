# Language/professional

This shows the type of professional that has
been requested for the booking. 

> **Note:** The data as it appears on monday.com
> seems to be a simplified version of the data
> that appears on example spreadsheet. 
>
> E.g. on monday.com the booking references an 
> Interpreter, but on the spreadsheet the same 
> appointment refers to a RNLI Interpreter. 
>
> It is recommended that the values on 
> monday.com are updated to match the expected
> output on the spreadsheet.
